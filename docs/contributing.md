# ü§ù Contributing to aMetro

aMetro is an open-source project that thrives on community support.  
There are several ways you can help improve the app.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Update or Fix Maps

- aMetro uses **PMZ map files**, originally from the pMetro project.  
- If you find an outdated or incorrect map, you can:  
  1. Extract and edit the `.pmz` file (see [Map Editing](maps-editing.md).  
  2. Send your updated map:  
     - Email it to **Boris@pMetro.su** (original pMetro author).  
     - Or open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/RomanGolovanov/ametro/issues) with the corrected file attached.

## üåê Help with Translations

- The **user interface** currently supports **English, Dutch (NL), French (FR), and Russian (RU)**.  
- **City names** are available in **24 languages**, so the app is globally accessible.  
- **Maps themselves** are usually in English only ‚Äî if you want to adapt a map to another language, you can patch it manually (see [Map Editing](maps-editing.md).  

If you‚Äôd like to add or improve translations:  
- Open a pull request with updated string files, or  
- Attach the updated translation to a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/RomanGolovanov/ametro/issues).
