## 📖 Project Background

aMetro is the Android counterpart of **pMetro**, a classic Windows application created by *Boris Muradov*.  
It uses the same **PMZ map format**, ensuring compatibility with the large library of hand-crafted metro and transit maps.  

The project was revived in **2025** with active development by [Roman Golovanov](https://github.com/RomanGolovanov).  
Recent work includes:  
- Updating UI for modern Android versions  
- Cleaning up legacy code
