# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** 26 September 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the mobile application **aMetro – World Subway Maps** (“App”) handles personal data.

**Author / Data Controller:** Roman Golovanov (<roman.golovanov@gmail.com>)

---

## Summary

- **No data collection:** The App does not collect, store, transmit, sell, share, or otherwise process personal data.  
- **No third-party SDKs or analytics:** The App does not integrate analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.  
- **No cookies or trackers:** The App does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies.  
- **Device permissions:** Certain optional OS permissions may be requested solely to provide features you initiate (e.g., storage access to load offline maps). Data accessed via such permissions is processed locally on your device and is not transmitted.

---

## Personal Data We Process

We do **not** process personal data. Specifically, the App does not collect identifiers, contact information, location data, usage data, diagnostics, financial information, health information, or any other data types.

---

## Legal Bases (GDPR/UK GDPR)

Because the App does not process personal data as defined under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK GDPR, no legal basis is required. If this changes, we will update this Policy and (where required) request consent or rely on another appropriate legal basis.

---

## International Data Transfers

No personal data is collected or transferred internationally.

---

## Retention

No personal data is collected; therefore, no retention applies. Any content you load into the App remains on your device under your control.

---

## Children’s Privacy

The App is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age thresholds set by applicable laws (e.g., under 13 per COPPA in the U.S., and under 16 in some EEA countries). If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will address it — even though the App itself does not collect such data.

---

## Your Rights

Depending on your location (e.g., EEA/UK, Brazil, California), you may have rights such as access, deletion, portability, correction, restriction, objection, and the right to opt out of certain processing or sharing. Because the App does not collect personal data, there is nothing for us to access, delete, or share. If you still wish to make a request, contact <roman.golovanov@gmail.com> and we will confirm that no personal data is held.

---

## Do Not Track / Global Privacy Control

The App does not track users and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals or Global Privacy Control (GPC). No cross-site tracking or targeted advertising occurs.

---

## California (CCPA/CPRA) Notice

We are a “business” only to the extent we collect personal information of California residents. We do not collect, “sell,” or “share” personal information (as those terms are defined by CCPA/CPRA). We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information. If you submit a verifiable consumer request, we will respond by confirming we have no personal information about you.

---

## Brazil (LGPD) Notice

Under the LGPD, we are a controller only to the extent we process personal data. We do not process personal data via the App. You may still contact us to exercise LGPD rights, and we will confirm that no data is processed.

---

## EEA/UK Supervisory Authority

If you are in the EEA or UK and believe your data protection rights have been infringed, you may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Given that the App does not process personal data, we expect no such issues, but we will cooperate with any authority as required.

---

## Security

The App processes content locally on your device and does not transmit personal data to our servers. You are responsible for securing your device, operating system, and backups.

---

## Third-Party Services

The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or external data processors. If you follow an external link (e.g., to a transit website), their privacy practices apply.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy to reflect functionality changes or legal requirements. If we ever introduce features that involve personal data, we will update this Policy before those changes take effect and, where required, obtain consent.
